# Markov-Based Temporal Filtering for Bag~of~Tracked~Words Performance Improvement

This open source MATLAB algorith presents a straightforward probabilistic appearance-based Loop Closure Detection (LCD) framework which relies on an image-to-map voting scheme based on an incremental version of Bag-of-Words methods avoiding any pre-trained technique. Feature tracking is performed using Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) point tracker and a guided-feature-detection technique. For each tracked feature, a Tracked Word (TW) is generated by averaging the instances of the corresponding descriptors. TWs are assigned to the map representing specific locations along the trajectory, while a Bag-of-Tracked-Words (BoTW) is constructed during the navigation. Working with scale and rotation invariant SURF local-features provides a built-in robustness towards view-point and velocity variations. At query time, local-feature-descriptors vote using a *k*-Nearest Neighbor technique, while a binomial Probability Density Function (PDF) is adapted as a belief generator among the candidate loop closing pairs.
